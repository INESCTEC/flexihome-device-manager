# FlexiHome: A Home Energy Management System 🔌<br><br>Device Manager


## Description

This repository contains the Device Manager Service, a core component of the Home Energy Management System (FlexiHome). The Device Manager Service is responsible for managing user accounts, authentication, and authorization within the FlexiHome ecosystem. It provides secure access to various functionalities and services offered by the FlexiHome platform.

## FlexiHome Overview

EMSs (Energy Management Systems) play a key role in the flexibility enablement of consumers, residential and tertiary, which is paramount to accessing the previously untapped flexibility potential of residential DERs (Distributed Energy Resources). These resources, under the form of energy assets, are usually household appliances like heat pumps, EV chargers, dishwashers, PV inverts, batteries, etc. This is where the FlexiHome (Home Energy Management System) comes in. 

The goal of this system is to facilitate the user’s participation in the flexibility value chain, while providing them with incentives in a clear, explainable way.

To fulfill this goal in an effective and scalable way, the FlexiHome is designed with a micro-services architecture (below), orchestrated in a Kubernetes environment, where each micro-service is modular and can be replaced or expanded, without breaking the remaining logic.

![FlexiHome Architecture](docs/diagrams/hems-architecture-diagram.svg)

FlexiHome utilizes an IoT interoperable gateway (FlexiHome Hub) to connect to the end users DERs via interoperable protocols like OCPP and Modbus, which connects with the cloud system (FlexiHome Cloud) via an MQTT message broker.

The cloud operations are done via micro-services, where the flexibility optimization algorithms run. To complement these micro-services, support applications like postgres (database), elasticsearch (log database), prometheus (performance metrics) and grafana (metrics dashboard) are used.

Lastly, the user can view the information regarding their devices and flexibility on a user interface provided by the mobile app, which accesses the FlexiHome microservices using a REST API Gateway for additional security measures and routing of requests.

### Project Status

- 🚧 In Progress: Actively being developed; features and structure may change.


### Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.8
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** Flask, SQLAlchemy, Alembic
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (recommended for deployment)
- **Other Tools:** Alembic (migrations), pytest (testing)


### Dependencies

All required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. For testing, see `test-requirements.txt`. Docker and Docker Compose are required for containerized deployments.


## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the Device Manager Service:

1. **Clone the repository:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/INESCTEC/hems-device-manager.git
  cd device-manager-service
  ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
